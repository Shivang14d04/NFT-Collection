# 🖼️ NFT Collection – Basic & Advanced Implementations

This repository demonstrates two approaches to building Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) using Solidity and modern Web3 tooling. The project includes a **basic IPFS-based NFT** and an **advanced on-chain dynamic NFT** that changes based on predefined conditions.

By the end of this project, you will be able to mint NFTs, store metadata properly, interact with them via MetaMask, and view them on marketplaces like OpenSea.

## 🚀 Features

### 1️⃣ Basic NFT (IPFS-based)
- Images and metadata stored on IPFS
- ERC-721 compliant smart contract
- Token URI pointing to decentralized storage
- Mintable via smart contract
- Viewable in MetaMask and NFT marketplaces

### 2️⃣ Advanced NFT (On-chain & Dynamic)
- SVG art stored fully on-chain
- Metadata generated dynamically
- NFT changes based on defined logic (e.g., mood: happy/sad)
- No external storage dependency
- Fully decentralized
